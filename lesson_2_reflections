What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Ans: When we initialise a repository, an empty .git file is created in the current directory which stores all the git related information like commits, logs etc.
We need to give a command 'git init' to to initialise a fit repository for the current directory.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Ans:Staging area in the intermediate between working directory and repository. While making a repository of a working directory, staging area gives us an option of adding whichever files we want to add in the repository. So according to our need, we can add files in the repository which needs to be commited.
