When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Ans: When I am working on a collaborated project or working in a team at my workplace, remote repository will come handy as the work done by anyone can be easy accessible.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Ans: Sometimes when I am working on something experimental like new features and I want to keep my work original and different from the people collaborating with me, I wont want my repository getting modified.
